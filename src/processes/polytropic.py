    T-s Diagram: A curved path that depends on the polytropic index
    - n = 1: Isothermal process (appears horizontal on a T-s diagram if entropy is changing due to heat transfer)
    - n = k (isentropic): Reverts to vertical as described above.
    - Includes some heat transfer but can be designed to approximate isentropic or isothermal behaviors
